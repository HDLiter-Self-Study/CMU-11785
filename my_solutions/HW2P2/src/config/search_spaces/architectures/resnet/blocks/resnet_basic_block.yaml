# BASIC BLOCK CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Note: Basic block has no specific parameters - it uses all parameters 
# from BaseResNetBlock (activation, normalization, SE, etc.) which are 
# handled at the architecture level in ResNet main config.

basic_block:
  class: "instance"
  condition: "$architecture_type == 'resnet'"
  
  # No block-specific parameters - all inherited from BaseResNetBlock
  # The basic block simply applies: 3x3 conv -> 3x3 conv with residual connection
