description: Write comments/docstrings in English, timeless, and oriented to new developers; avoid change-log phrasing
---
### Comments and docstrings style

- Write all comments and docstrings in English.
- Document for a new developer, not for the current change process.
  - Avoid phrasing like "this function adds parameter X" or "now supports Y".
  - Prefer timeless descriptions like "This function has five parameters" and describe each parameter's role.
- Focus on purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects, invariants, and error conditions.
- Keep comments concise and high-signal; explain "why" more than "how" when the code is clear.
- Remove outdated or misleading comments; do not keep change-log style notes in code.

### Python docstrings

- Use language-appropriate docstrings (for Python, triple-quoted docstrings) at module, class, and function levels.
- Prefer Google-style docstrings (or match existing project style) including:
  - Args: parameter names, types, and meanings.
  - Returns: type and meaning of the return value.
  - Raises: specific exceptions and when they occur.
  - Notes/Examples: only when they add significant value.
- Avoid TODOs in code; if necessary, make them actionable with owner and deadline, otherwise track in issues.
