description: Fail-fast coding guidance â€” raise exceptions instead of silent fallbacks; clear docs for new contributors
---
### Fail-fast principle

- Validate inputs early and raise explicit exceptions on invalid state.
- Avoid silent fallbacks, implicit defaults, or broad `except` blocks that swallow errors.
- Prefer guard clauses and clear error messages over continuing in an unknown state.
- CLI entry points should exit with non-zero status on failure and print an actionable message.

### Error handling guidance

- Catch only expected exceptions and re-raise with context; never mask the root cause.
- Log details at the failure site; do not defer critical checks.

### Code clarity for new developers

- Include concise docstrings and high-signal comments explaining intent and invariants.
- Remove outdated or misleading comments during edits.
