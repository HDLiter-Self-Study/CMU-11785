description: If an edit instruction seems problematic, pause edits and seek secondary confirmation with analysis
---
### Confirmation when concerns arise

- When the user issues an instruction to edit code and there are concerns (ambiguity, risky side effects, conflicts with existing design, security/performance issues, or inconsistency with project rules), do not proceed with edits immediately.
- First, present a brief analysis outlining:
  - What appears problematic and why.
  - Safer or clearer alternatives.
  - Any assumptions or missing details that block safe implementation.
- Ask for the user's secondary confirmation before making any code changes.
