# CMU 11785 HW2P2: Face Classification & Verification - Project Report

## Lessons Learned (will first complete this section after every milestone)
1. **What to do when AI agents have done too much for you?**: There were times when I just wanted the AI to provide an organized draft framework for me and give me an example of those third-party libraries, then I would fill do the core logic myself. However, the AI agents were so sweet that they would do everything for me, even if I had told them to only provide a draft.ðŸ¥º However, I'm here to learn deep learning, not to learn how to use AI agents. Luckily, I came across a clever strategy to process these over-cooked codes: **Tell the AI agents to delete working codes in the implementation and make them exercises for me (Like in those HWP1s).ðŸ˜Ž** After that I had quite a productive time re-implementing those parts myself and reinforcing my understanding. Next time, I will be more specific about my needs and set clearer boundaries for the AI's assistance.
