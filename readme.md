## Personal Self-Study Repository On CMU-11785

This repository is my personal self-study repository for the course [CMU-11785](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S24/index.html), it mainly contains homework resources and my solutions to the homework and projects.

It contains the following two main folders:
- `course_materials`: This folder contains the homework resources I collected from the course website and other sources. These resources together with the course website will be enough for you to complete the homework and projects. So feel free to use them as you wish.😋 For more details, please refer to the individual files and folders.

- `my_solutions`: This folder contains my solutions to the homework and projects. You can use them as a reference, but please do not copy them directly. 😊


## Currently Under Construction
This repository is currently under construction, I will keep updating it as I progress through the course.
